## Technical Changes Made

1. **Fixed Query Invalidation Issue**
   - Removed `onSettled` that was causing double invalidation
   - Now using `onSuccess` to set server response directly
   - No more race conditions between optimistic update and server

2. **Consistent API Responses**
   - All endpoints (POST, PATCH, DELETE) now return enriched cart
   - Format: `{ success: true, cart: [...] }`
   - Cart items include product details

3. **Proper State Management**
   - Optimistic updates show immediately
   - Server response replaces optimistic data
   - No invalidation causing refetch with stale data

4. **Fixed "One Step Behind" Issue**
   - Was caused by invalidation overwriting fresh data
   - Now server response is directly set to cache
   - No more disappearing items after 1-2 seconds
