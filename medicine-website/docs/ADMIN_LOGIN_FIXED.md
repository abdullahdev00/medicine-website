# Admin Login Fixed! ✅

## Issue Resolved
The admin login was failing because the session wasn't being created properly. This has now been fixed!

## How to Test Admin Login

### Step 1: Go to Login Page
Navigate to `/login` in your browser

### Step 2: Enter Admin Credentials
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

### Step 3: Click "Sign In"
You should see:
- Success toast: "Welcome Admin!"
- Automatic redirect to `/admin` dashboard
- All admin data loads properly (no 401 errors)

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Not Working)
- Admin logged in via `/api/auth/login`  
- ❌ No admin session created
- ❌ Backend couldn't verify admin
- ❌ All `/api/admin/*` routes returned 401 Unauthorized

### After (Working Now)
- Admin logs in via `/api/admin/login`  
- ✅ Admin session created with `req.session.adminId`
- ✅ Backend verifies admin via session
- ✅ All `/api/admin/*` routes work properly

## Technical Details

The login flow now:
1. First tries admin login (`/api/admin/login`) - creates session
2. If admin login fails, tries regular user login (`/api/auth/login`)
3. Admin users go to `/admin` dashboard
4. Regular users go to `/home` page
5. All admin routes are protected and check session

## Test It Now!

Try logging in as:

**Admin:**
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Should see admin dashboard with all stats

**Regular User:**
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `test123`
- Should see customer homepage with products

Both logins working perfectly now! 🎉
