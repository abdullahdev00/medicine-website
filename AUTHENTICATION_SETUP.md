# Authentication & LocalStorage Setup

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

### **User Data Storage in localStorage**

The authentication system now properly stores user data in localStorage when users log in, allowing them to access protected routes.

### **Key Components Updated**

#### 1. **Auth Provider (`lib/providers.tsx`)**
- ✅ **localStorage Integration**: Automatically saves/loads user data from localStorage
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Users stay logged in across browser sessions
- ✅ **Cross-tab Sync**: Login/logout syncs across multiple tabs
- ✅ **Auto-restore**: User session restored on app reload

#### 2. **Login Flow (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)**
- ✅ **User Sync**: Syncs user to database after Supabase authentication
- ✅ **localStorage Storage**: Stores user data and `isLoggedIn` flag
- ✅ **Auth Context Update**: Updates auth provider state
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if database sync fails

#### 3. **Email Verification (`app/verify-email/page.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Post-verification Login**: Automatically logs user in after email verification
- ✅ **Auth Context Integration**: Uses auth provider's login function
- ✅ **Consistent Flow**: Same user data structure as login

#### 4. **Protected Routes (`components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)**
- ✅ **localStorage Auth**: Uses localStorage-based auth provider
- ✅ **Role-based Access**: Supports different user roles (user, admin, partner, buyer)
- ✅ **Automatic Redirects**: Redirects to login if not authenticated
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while checking auth

#### 5. **Protected Layout (`app/(protected)/layout.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Route Protection**: All protected routes automatically check authentication
- ✅ **User Access Control**: Only authenticated users can access protected pages
- ✅ **Seamless UX**: Smooth loading and redirect experience

### **How It Works**

#### **Login Process:**
1. User enters credentials → Supabase authentication
2. User data synced to local database (with fallback)
3. User data stored in localStorage with `isLoggedIn: true`
4. Auth context updated with user data
5. User redirected to home page

#### **Protected Route Access:**
1. User navigates to protected route (e.g., `/profile`, `/cart`, `/orders`)
2. Protected layout checks `isAuthenticated` from auth context
3. Auth context reads from localStorage on app load
4. If authenticated: User accesses the page
5. If not authenticated: User redirected to `/login`

#### **Session Persistence:**
1. User closes browser and reopens
2. Auth provider automatically checks localStorage on app load
3. If valid session found: User remains logged in
4. If no session: User needs to log in again

### **User Data Structure in localStorage**

```javascript
// localStorage.getItem('user')
{
  "id": "user-uuid-from-supabase",
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "fullName": "User Full Name",
  "userType": "user" // or "admin", "partner", "buyer"
}

// localStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn')
"true" // or removed if logged out
```

### **Protected Routes Available**

All routes under `app/(protected)/` are now protected:
- `/profile` - User profile management
- `/cart` - Shopping cart
- `/checkout` - Order checkout
- `/orders` - Order history
- `/wishlist` - User wishlist
- `/wallet` - Wallet management
- `/addresses` - Address management
- `/vouchers` - Voucher management
- `/settings` - User settings

### **Console Logging**

The system provides detailed console logs for debugging:
- `"User restored from localStorage:"` - On app load
- `"User logged in and stored in localStorage:"` - On login
- `"User logged out and localStorage cleared"` - On logout
- `"User session restored:"` - When session is found

### **Testing the Implementation**

1. **Login Test:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Enter valid credentials
   - Check browser console for "User logged in and stored in localStorage"
   - Check localStorage in DevTools

2. **Protected Route Test:**
   - After login, navigate to `/profile` or `/cart`
   - Should access without redirect
   - Try accessing while logged out - should redirect to `/login`

3. **Session Persistence Test:**
   - Login and close browser
   - Reopen and navigate to protected route
   - Should remain logged in

4. **Logout Test:**
   - Click logout
   - Try accessing protected route
   - Should redirect to login

### **Error Handling**

- **Database Sync Failure**: User can still login with localStorage-only auth
- **Network Issues**: Non-blocking warnings, authentication continues
- **Invalid Sessions**: Automatically cleared and user redirected to login
- **Cross-tab Logout**: Logout in one tab logs out all tabs

The authentication system is now robust, user-friendly, and properly handles localStorage persistence for protected route access.
